# Overview

Looking at lego set no. 21313 (ship in bottle) I was wondering about 1x1 round pieces. Mentioned set contains 284 this round elements and it barely fills bottom of the bottle, hence I got curious how many of them would we need to fill whole bottle. As I was doing research I found mosaics made from similar elements and number of them was ten times higher than what we could see in bottle set. 

# Calculations

Quickly I formed few models to estimate how much space would it take.
